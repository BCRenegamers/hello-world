beginning repository for BC Renegamers

Repository started by Chad Hidalgo, the founding President of BC Renegamers. A BC student since Spring 2014, Chad began at BC with the pursuit of an associates degree in Computer Information Systems and planned to transfer to CSUB. The Computer Studies department was undergoing drastic changes to introduce the Associate Degree for Transer and Chad changed his major to Computer Science A.S.T. Chad started a Computer Science club at Bakersfield College and then became BCSGA Director of Student Organizations for the 2015/2016 Fiscal Year. Chad heard about a new program at Bakersfield College offering a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Automation and once again was pursuaded to change his major in order to enter the Bachelor's Degree program at Bakersfield College. While serving as Director of Student Organizations, Chad met Ed Webb from CSUB and was introduced to the world of Extra Life. In April 2016, BC had its first ExtraLife Mini-Marathon and it was a great success. The goal was to earn $1500 and that was exceeded by $459. It was a great feeling to have a check made to CMN Hospitals for $1959 and it was decided that a chapter of Campus Gamers would be started at BC to make sure that ExtraLife happens at Bakersfield College every year.

BC Renegamers is also aiming to help students earn scholarships through e-sports collegiate competition leagues.
